# Current package

World drag sources use `UI.draggable` with `world` options and the shared drop
session. World targets supply `worldPlacement` through `DropInfo`. See
[world drag and drop](docs/reference/nodes/draggable-and-dropTarget.world.md).

`Facet.Compose` now includes `Compose.map` from Compose d74f653.
`Compose.map(source, transform)` returns a body that transforms the value of one
cell or formula. A property bound to it updates without dependency tracking.

## 0.12.0

Facet provides Roblox UI controls built on Compose and native engine APIs.
Use the [API reference](docs/reference/api.md) for public contracts and the
[architecture](docs/guide/architecture.md) for ownership and engine integration.
Use the [game UI design guide](skills/use-facet/references/GAME_UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md)
for composition, input, and device decisions.

The version in `src/init.luau` identifies the source package. A local build does
not publish it. Run `lute run tools/facet package status` for publication and
verification status. See [package operations](package/README.md).

The [verification scope](docs/guide/verification-scope.md) defines evidence
limits. The [evaluation protocol](eval/README.md) defines game comparisons;
`eval/latest` contains the latest saved submissions.
