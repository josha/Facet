### Options and native properties

Control-specific options use lower camel case. Native properties keep their
Roblox names: `Size`, `Position`, `AutomaticSize`, `LayoutOrder`, `Visible`,
`TextSize` and the others. The control forwards native events, Compose property
and event keys, `Attributes` and numeric children to the host. To add native
tags, use `node:AddTag(name)`. An unsupported control option causes an error.
It does not become inert metadata. The error names the control and, when an
option is close, suggests it:
`Facet UI.Button: unknown option 'lable'. Did you mean 'label'?`. A spec that is
not a table gives `Facet UI.Button: expected a property table, got number`.
